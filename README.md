The code included utilizes monthly wind data from Washington State and incorporates it into a 2-D advectino structure which models the flow of smoke particles through the atmosphere in the hours and days following a wildfire.
The model is centered around Washington State and seperates the state into 4 seperate regions to use the most accurate information
Input into this model is wind speeds and the output is smoke concentration over time across latitude and longitude.
