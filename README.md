EV320 Smoke is the final version of the code --- annotated with full process
EV320 1-D is an earlier version of this coded. This was a test of my data on a 1-D advection system before moving on to 2-D
Day 12: 2-D Advection is code from class which is used as a foundation for the wildfire smoke model.
###
The EV320 Smoke code included utilizes monthly wind data from Washington State and incorporates it into a 2-D advectino structure which models the flow of smoke particles through the atmosphere in the hours and days following a wildfire.
The model is centered around Washington State and seperates the state into 4 seperate regions to use the most accurate information
Input into this model is wind speeds and the output is smoke concentration over time across latitude and longitude.
